    <h3>One of my favorite quotes</h3>
    <!--
        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure.

        <p>
          Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead... only try
          to realize the truth...
          There is no spoon.
